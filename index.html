  <span class="hint-link" onclick="toggleHint('hint1')">EU Green</span>
  <div id="hint1" class="hint-text">The EU's challenge is that its goal of energy transition depends on inputs it cannot control, creating a fragile supply chain dependency that exposes it to geopolitical leverage, environmental backlash, and some ethical inconsistency. To go farther you will need some hypothese about the future. For example: Governments are expected to view critical minerals as strategic assets. Export bans, tariffs, and nationalizations will rise. Despite advancements in AI-driven materials science, a large-scale substitute for lithium and cobalt won't emerge by 2030. Countries in the global south will seek tech-for-resource exchanges that incorporate ESG enforcement, moving away from extractive neo-colonial practices. Sould the EU align with china or actually use a hostile China to drive urgent political action in Europe?</div>

  <span class="hint-link" onclick="toggleHint('hint2')">Apple</span>
  <div id="hint2" class="hint-text">CoreAI is perceived merely as a supplementary feature rather than a strategic platform, whereas competitors are redefining user interactions with devices, content, and tools within AI-first ecosystems. A key paradox lies in its insistence on local inference, which compromises the model's depth and real-time updates. Additionally, its stringent App Store control stifles innovation and the development of third-party models. This lack of engagement with developers is crucial because, without their involvement, CoreAI risks losing relevance in the future.</div>
